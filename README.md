# QSpotify

*Play Spotify tracks and playlists, as well as fades and loops, all from within QLab*

Using QSpotify is very simple. Start by [downloading this repository](https://github.com/sparks-alec/QSpotify/archive/master.zip).

1- Open `QSpotify Demo.qlab4` in the downloaded folder

2- Open QLab's Cue List pane by clicking the list icon in the bottom right corner of the main QLab window.

3- Navigate to the `Spotify Config` Cue List

4- Change the Q Name of the `SPOTPATH` cue to reflect the path to the `QSpotify_1.3.scpt` file on your computer. This .scpt file was included in the downloaded repository. EX: `/Users/yourname/Downloads/QSpotify-master/QSpotify_1.3.scpt`

If running a QSpotify cue returns an error such as `ERROR: A real number can't go after this identifier` or `ERROR: A "/" can't go here.`, there is likely a problem with the path to the QSpotify scpt file.




A paid version of QLab is mostly necessary for QSpotify, becuase saved Script cues cannot be loaded with the free version.
