# QSpotify

*Play Spotify tracks and playlists, as well as fades and loops, all from within QLab*

Using QSpotify is very simple. Start by [downloading this repository](https://github.com/sparks-alec/QSpotify/archive/master.zip).

1- Open `QSpotify Demo.cues` in the downloaded folder

2- Open QLab's Cue List pane by clicking the list icon in the bottom right corner of the main QLab window.

3- Navigate to the `Spotify Config` Cue List

4- Change the Q Name of the `SPOTPATH` cue to reflect the path to the `QSpotify_1.1.scpt` file on your computer. This .scpt file was included in the downloaded repository. This path should be colon-separated. EX: `Macintosh HD:Users:Me:Desktop:QSpotify:QSpotify_1.1.scpt`


A paid version of QLab is mostly necessary for QSpotify, becuase saved Script cues cannot be loaded with the free version.
